# ChatSpeed v1.1.0 Release Notes

Hello everyone! We are thrilled to announce the release of ChatSpeed v1.1.0. We've jumped directly from v1.0.4 to v1.1.0 because this version includes a series of milestone updates, especially regarding the **proxy module's Tool Compatibility Mode** and **search engine support**, which will significantly enhance the AI's capabilities and stability.

## üöÄ New Features

1.  **Powerful Search Engine Integration**
    - Now supports integration with major search engines via API keys, including **Google Search API**, **Tavily API**, and **Serper API**.
    - Additionally, built-in support for **Bing, DuckDuckGo, So.com, and Sougou** is included, providing you with diverse information sources.

2.  **Web Content Scraping & Analysis**
    - A new built-in web scraper has been added, capable of extracting text or Markdown content from a given URL, allowing the AI to fetch and analyze real-time web information.

3.  **Flexible Prompt Injection**
    - To better accommodate different models (especially those with weaker support for the `system` role), you can now choose to inject enhancement prompts into either the `system` role or the last `user` message, greatly improving compatibility.

## ‚ú® Enhancements

The core of this update is a deep refactoring and optimization of the **proxy module's "Tool Compatibility Mode,"** aiming for a more stable, compatible, and fluid intelligent experience.

### 1. More Stable Tool Invocation

By refactoring the underlying tool compatibility mode, we have significantly improved the stability and accuracy of AI tool execution. Optimized tool definitions (with required parameters listed first and labeled `(required)`/`(optional)`) and stricter formatting rules provide a clear set of "guardrails" for the AI, better driving different models (even weaker ones) to execute tasks stably and accurately.

### 2. Customizable Cross-Model Compatibility

We've introduced a flexible prompt injection mechanism. You can now choose to inject enhancement prompts into the `system` or `user` message. This feature allows for optimization based on the characteristics of different models, solving issues where some models respond poorly to the `system` role, and significantly improving the performance of various models in clients like `claude code`.

### 3. Workflow Optimization via Prompt Guidance

We have greatly optimized the prompts to assist the AI in forming a more robust and less interruptible workflow. This includes guiding the AI in task planning (prioritizing tools like `TodoWrite`) and implementing intelligent fault tolerance (providing a detailed "correction guide" when tool call parsing fails), thereby significantly increasing the success rate of complex tasks.

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixed a state management bug in the stream processor that caused tool call parsing to fail.
- Fixed an issue where an XML parameter value would incorrectly become `0` or `false` if it could not be parsed as the specified type (e.g., number). It now safely falls back to preserving the original string, preventing data corruption.
