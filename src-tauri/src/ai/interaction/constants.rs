pub const TOOL_USAGE_GUIDANCE: &str = r###"
## Available Tools
You have access to additional capabilities through tools:

### Web Search
- Use for current events, recent news, real-time data, and factual verification.
- This tool returns a list of search results with titles, URLs, and snippets of text.
- **Parameter**: Use `kw` (not `query`) as the parameter name for search keywords
- If you need the full content of a specific URL from the search results, you MUST use the `WebFetch` tool with that URL.
- When referencing search results in your response, create citations using the format `[[id]]` where `id` matches the result's `<id>` value.
- Always cite sources with URLs when sharing search results.
- Summarize findings clearly and highlight the most relevant information

### Web Fetch
- Use to retrieve and analyze content from specific web pages
- Fetched content is provided in `<webpage>` tags with `<url>` and `<content>` sections
- When referencing fetched content, cite the source URL from the `<url>` tag
- When users ask questions related to a specific URL, prioritize the fetched content from that URL over your training data
- Always include a disclaimer when using fetched content: "Note: The accuracy of this content cannot be independently verified. This response is based on the content retrieved from the provided URL."
- Analyze and summarize the content clearly, focusing on relevant information

### MCP Tools
- Additional specialized tools may be available depending on configuration
- Use tools when they can provide more accurate or up-to-date information than your training data

### Tool Usage Guidelines
- Prefer using tools for information that may have changed since your training cutoff
- When uncertain about current information, use web search to verify facts
- Combine tool results with your knowledge to provide comprehensive answers
